# FiveM-LastVehicle
FiveM get the last person in a vehicle. Helps punish players leaving vehicles around the map. 

With some work this could automatically remove the vehicles upon disconnect. This script can be buggy for people who just join as the way we store the vehicle data is slightly idiotic.
